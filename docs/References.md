If you would like more information on the muon selection workflow, please go to this link [ndlar-flow](https://github.com/DUNE/ndlar_flow). <br>
The above link will hopefully provide more context on how the muon selection would apply to the total workflow of ndlar-flow. Also, if you would like to run the total ndlar-flow that is the place to learn.
